63. Program to find Container with most water (LeetCode 11),Python
Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array height of length n. Each element represents the height of a vertical line drawn at position i.
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container holds the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Example:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The lines at indices 1 and 8 form the container with the maximum area = min(8,7) * (8-1) = 7 * 7 = 49.

Intuition:
The area (amount of water) between two lines depends on:
The shorter line’s height (since water can’t go above it).
The distance between the two lines.
We can use a two-pointer technique:
Start with one pointer at the beginning and one at the end.
Calculate the area.
Move the pointer with the smaller height inward, since moving the taller one won’t increase the height of the container.

Python Solution:
def max_area(height):
    left = 0
    right = len(height) - 1
    max_water = 0

    while left < right:
        # Calculate the area
        width = right - left
        area = min(height[left], height[right]) * width
        max_water = max(max_water, area)

        # Move the pointer with the smaller height
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    
    return max_water
